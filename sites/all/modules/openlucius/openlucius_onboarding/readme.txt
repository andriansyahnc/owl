[Openlucius onboarding module]

This module guides users through their initial profile setup.
The first user get's to watch an introduction video, setup their profile,
invite 4 teammembers and create a group to start working.
If the module is enabled on an existing install,
the first full onboarding is skipped.
Every other user, unless the user existed before the module was enabled,
get's to setup their profile.
